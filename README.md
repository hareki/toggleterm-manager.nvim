## ‚ú® Features

- List all Toggleterm terminal buffers and preview them in Telescope
- Create, open, delete, toggle, and rename terminal buffers 
- Easily customize the appearance of the Telescope window

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim)
- [Toggleterm](https://github.com/akinsho/nvim-toggleterm.lua)

## ‚ö° Quickstart

### Lazy

```lua
{
  "ryanmsnyder/toggleterm-manager.nvim",
  dependencies = {
    "akinsho/nvim-toggleterm.lua",
    "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim", -- only needed because it's a dependency of telescope
  },
  config = true,
}
```

Open `toggleterm-manager` by either:

- running the command `:Telescope toggleterm_manager`
- calling `lua require('toggleterm-manager').open()`

Keep reading if you want to change the default configuration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (optional)

If you want to change the defaults, instead of passing `true` to `lazy`'s `config` option, either: 

Pass the desired options to `lazy`'s `opts`:

```lua
opts = {
  titles = {
    prompt = "Pick Term",
    results = "Terminals"
  },
  -- more overrides if desired
},
```

or call `toggletem-manager`'s `setup` function with the options you want to change:

```lua
config = function()
  require("toggleterm-manager").setup {
    titles = {
      prompt = "Pick Term",
      results = "Terminals"
    },
    -- more overrides if desired
  }
end
```

### Defaults

By default, the below table is passed to the `setup` function:

```lua
{
  mappings = { -- key mappings bound inside the telescope window
    i = {
      ["<CR>"] = { action = actions.toggle_term, exit_on_action = false }, -- toggles terminal open/closed
      ["<C-i>"] = { action = actions.create_term, exit_on_action = false }, -- creates a new terminal buffer
      ["<C-d>"] = { action = actions.delete_term, exit_on_action = false }, -- deletes a terminal buffer
      ["<C-r>"] = { action = actions.rename_term, exit_on_action = false }, -- provides a prompt to rename a terminal
    },
  },
  titles = {
    preview = "Preview", -- title of the preview buffer in telescope
    prompt = "Ôíâ Terminals", -- title of the prompt buffer in telescope
    results = "Results", -- title of the results buffer in telescope
  },
  results = {
    fields = { -- fields that will appear in the results of the telescope window
      "state", -- the state of the terminal buffer: h = hidden, a = active
      "space", -- adds space between fields, if desired
      "term_icon", -- a terminal icon
      "term_name", -- toggleterm's display_name if it exists, else the terminal's id assigned by toggleterm
    },
    separator = " ", -- the character that will be used to separate each field provided in results.fields  
    term_icon = "Ôíâ", -- the icon that will be used for term_icon in results.fields
  },
  search = {
    field = "term_name" -- the field that telescope fuzzy search will use when typing in the prompt
  },
  sort = {
    field = "term_name", -- the field that will be used for sorting in the telesocpe results
	ascending = true, -- whether or not the field provided above will be sorted in ascending or descending order
  },
}
```

Each mode (`i` for insert mode, `n` for normal mode) is a key in the table and maps to another table, where the key is the key combination (e.g., "C-r") and the value is a table with the fields `action` and `exit_on_action`. The `action` field is a function that will be called when the key combination is pressed, and `exit_on_action` is a boolean that determines whether Telescope should be exited after the action is performed.

### Mappings

If you'd like to override the default keybindings, the `mappings` table should look something like this:

```lua
local toggleterm_manager = require("toggleterm-manager")
local actions = toggleterm_manager.actions

toggleterm_manager.setup {
	mappings = {
	    i = {
	      ["<CR>"] = { action = actions.create_and_name_term, exit_on_action = true },
	      ["<C-d>"] = { action = actions.delete_term, exit_on_action = false },
	      ["<C-i>"] = false, -- unbinds the default mapping
	    },
	    n = {
	      ["<CR>"] = { action = actions.create_and_name_term, exit_on_action = true },
	      ["x"] = { action = actions.delete_term, exit_on_action = false },
	    },
	},
}
```

Note that each key in the table should correspond to the NeoVim mode that the mappings should apply to (`i` for insert, `n` for normal). Each mode key should contain another table of key/value pairs where the key is the keybinding and the value is another table of key/value pairs. The valid keys of that table are `action`, which takes a function that manipulates a terminal in some way and `exit_on_action`, which determines if the Telescope window should be closed on the execution of the action.

#### Actions

There are six pre-defined actions that can be mapped to key bindings within the Telescope window.

> **Floating Toggleterm windows:** When configuring Toggleterm (not `toggleterm-manager`), there is a property called `direction`, which takes a value of `horizontal`, `vertical`, or `float`. Some of the actions behave differently if `direction = float`. This is because of how NeoVim handles floating windows. Telescope is already a floating window so if, for example, `direction = float`, and the `create_term` action is called with `exit_on_action = false`, there would normally be a flash caused by opening a Toggleterm float and switching back to Telescope really fast. To prevent this, the Toggleterm window will be created as a `hidden` terminal. Note that the `open_mapping` in Toggleterm config won't be able to toggle these terminals open/closed.

The below table displays the behavior of each action given different values for `exit_on_action` and Toggleterm's `direction` property that's passed to its [`setup`](https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim#setup) function.

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Action</th>
        <th colspan="2"><code>exit_on_action = true</code></th>
        <th colspan="2"><code>exit_on_action = false</code></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th></th>
        <th><code>direction = float</code></th>
        <th><code>direction != float</code></th>
        <th><code>direction = float</code></th>
        <th><code>direction != float</code></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>create_term</code></td>
        <td>Create and focus a new terminal</td>
        <td>Create and focus a new terminal</td>

        <td>Create a new terminal</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

        <td>Create, name, and focus a new terminal</td>
        <td>Create, name, and focus a new terminal</td>
        <td>Create a <i>hidden</i> terminal and name it</td>

        <td><code>rename_term</code></td>
        <td>Rename and focus the terminal if open</td>
        <td>Rename and focus the terminal if open</td>
        <td>Rename the terminal</td>
        <td>Rename the terminal</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>open_term</code></td>
        <td>Open and focus the terminal</td>
        <td>Open and focus the terminal</td>
        <td>Nothing will happen</td>
        <td>Open the terminal</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>toggle_term</code></td>
        <td>Toggle terminal open or closed, focus if open</td>
        <td>Toggle terminal open or closed, focus if open</td>
        <td>Toggle terminal open or closed</td>
        <td>Toggle terminal open or closed</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>delete_term</code></td>
        <td>Delete the terminal</td>
        <td>Delete the terminal</td>
        <td>Delete the terminal</td>
        <td>Delete the terminal</td>
    </tr>
</table>




#### Custom Actions

User-created functions can also be provided. Any function passed in as an action will receive two arguments: `prompt_bufnr` and `exit_on_action`.

```lua
local function my_custom_action(prompt_bufnr, exit_on_action)

    -- get current telescope selection
    local selection = actions_state.get_selected_entry()
	if selection == nil then
		return
	end

    -- get toggleterm's Terminal object
	local term = selection.value

    -- do something with the terminal
    term:open()
end
```

- Once Toggleterm's Terminal object is retrieved as seen above, any of [Toggleterm's Terminal methods](https://github.com/akinsho/toggleterm.nvim/blob/main/lua/toggleterm/terminal.lua#L188) can be used (`term:focus()`, `term:spawn()`, etc).

- Note that this is a simplified exampled. Getting actions to work as intended can feel a bit hacky because of both Toggleterm and Telescope controlling which NeoVim window should be focused. 

- See [`actions/init.lua`](https://github.com/ryanmsnyder/toggleterm-manager.nvim/blob/main/lua/lib/actions/init.lua) for examples of creating actions. 

### Results

The `results` property allows for easy customization of how Toggleterm's terminal buffers appear in the Telescope results buffer. `results.fields` allows for specifying the order that the results fields should appear, from left to right. Any combination and any number of the valid fields may be provided.

| `bufname`   | File name of the terminal buffer.                                                                                                                  |
| `bufnr`     | Buffer number of the terminal.                                                                                                                     |
| `space`     | Create additional space in between fields.                                                                                                         |
| `state`     | Current state of the terminal buffer. `h` = hidden, `a` = active                                                                                   |
| `term_icon` |  An icon of a terminal. This icon can be overridden with the `results.term_icon` property. |
| `term_name` | Toggleterm's `display_name` of the terminal, if assigned. Else, the `id`/`toggle_number` of the terminal assigned by Toggleterm upon creation.                                                          |

#### Results Highlight Groups

The background and foreground colors of the results fields can also be customized by pairing any one of the above fields with a valid highlight group.

#### Examples

Example of only providing fields (no highlight groups). When a highlight group is not specified for a field, `toggleterm-manager` chooses the highlight group:

```lua
local toggleterm_manager = require("toggleterm-manager")
local actions = toggleterm_manager.actions

toggleterm_manager.setup {
  results = {
    fields = { "term_icon", "term_name", "space", "state" }
  },
}
```

Example of providing highlight groups for some fields and not for others. When a highlight group is paired with a field in a table, that highlight group overrides the default that `toggleterm-manager` chooses.

```lua
results = {
  fields = { "state", "space", { "bufnr", "TelescopeResultsIdentifier" }, "space", "term_icon", { "bufname", "Function" } }
}
```
